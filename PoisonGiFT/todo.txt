++fix itunes importing into classic version of itunes "this is a situation caued by people who use both classic and cocoa itunes we can only called the application the OS knows to be itunes. these users should stop using OS9, its dead. Or just stop using itunes in OS9 at the very least. This is like asking us to fix loading of classic IE when they have classic IE as their default browser."

**quote:"Just thought I'd give you a heads-up - I'm not sure which version of iTunes added this, maybe it's always been there, but you can rename the Library to anything you want... then when the songs import from Poisoned they are added to a playlist called 'Library' instead of the library, since the name is different. The songs are still in the library, too, so it's not really that big of a deal, so this is  a pretty minor bug."
